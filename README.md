### Description
3D flight simulator of remotely controlled model airplanes in virtual reality for the SAE aerodesign competition team.
In addition to allowing practice flying without running the risk of damaging the model, it also offers the possibility to try out different weather conditions and flight scenarios. This helps pilots prepare for real situations and improve their flying skills. In this scenario, it is evident how much the universe of virtual reality is in progress. In this way, the formulation and modeling of the problem was carried out through the equations of motion, inclusion of the ground effect and gusts, for better computational efficiency, this formulation was applied in the Unity Physics Engine, streamlining the construction of the simulator. Detailing, implementation and construction of the base simulator were carried out, already allowing an initial assessment of stability, loads, control, visualization of the path and detailed monitoring of the flight.
